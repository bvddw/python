Everyone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and without concealing it he tried to be with Natasha all day. Not only in her look, but in her very soul, Natasha was dearer to him than ever, and he felt that this darling of his heart, whom he not merely loved but worshiped, was now in some way a stranger, an acquaintance, that had no place in his life.

The troops, dressed in their finest uniforms, marched proudly forward to the sound of drums and trumpets, and the flags of their regiments fluttered in the wind. The generals rode back and forth, their plumes waving in the air, and Napoleon himself, surrounded by his staff, gazed out at the spectacle with a look of intense concentration.
